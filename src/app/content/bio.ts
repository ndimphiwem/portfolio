    content: `I'm an experienced developer with varied experience in both back-end and front-end
    development technologies ranging from SQL, C# Java, and the MVC framework to
    JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS along with front-end frameworks like Angular, Bootstrap,
    Material Design Bootstrap, and JQuery.
    The challenge that drives me is the blending of back-end logic with the creativity of front-end
    presentation to solve problems or bring ideas to life.
    Ixve also made a more front-end focused pivot in my career, and to that end, Angular has
    become my flavour of development with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML all having a core role in
    my toolbox, than in previous years where I was primarily a full stack web developer.`
